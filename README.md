Task Description:
This Python script implements a text summarization tool using a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The script is designed to process lengthy articles and generate concise summaries. 

Features:
1. Efficient pipeline initialization to prevent redundant loading of the model.
2. A summarization function that processes text with customizable length constraints.
3. Error handling to manage unexpected input issues.
4. Modular design to ensure maintainability and reusability.

Usage:
- The script initializes a summarization model.
- It takes a predefined input text and generates a summarized version.
- The results are printed to the console.

This tool is useful for quickly extracting key points from large documents, making it beneficial for researchers, students, and professionals who deal with extensive text data.
